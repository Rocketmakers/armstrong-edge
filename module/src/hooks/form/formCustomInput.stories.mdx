Creating an input that can be bound to a form property is as simple as creating a component with a bind prop that supplies the expected type as a generic.

The Armstrong form library also supplies a hook that helps convert the complex binding tools into a simple value/setter.

At it's simplest, this is a text input component expecting a `string` as it's bound property:

```tsx
interface ICustomTextInputProps {
  bind: Form.IBindingProps<string>; // the "string" here can be any type, and should match the type expected in the form data.
}

const CustomTextInput: React.FC<ICustomTextInputProps> = (props) => {
  const [boundValue, boundOnChange, { myValidationErrorMessages }] = Form.useBindingState(props.bind);

  return (
    <>
      <input type="text" value={boundValue} onChange={boundOnChange} />

      <ValidationErrors validationErrors={myValidationErrorMessages} />
    </>
  );
};
```

There are plenty of advanced tools within the bind prop, and the use of the `useBindingState` prop is entirely optional, as long as you're careful to implement the features of the form binder within your custom input then you're good to go!

Here's the full list of tools contained within a `bind` that your custom inputs can interface with:
