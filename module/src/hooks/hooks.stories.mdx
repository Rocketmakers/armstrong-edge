# Utility Hooks

Armstrong exports a number of simple hooks that are used internally and available externally.

Not all hooks are documented here:

- for others see the rest of the `Hooks` section of Storybook
- for the form hook, see `Form/Form Hook`

### useArrayState

Store an array value in state, and access push, pull, clear methods to interact with that state - all contained within a reducer, meaning that multiple state updates can happen in a single thread without any unusual behaviors

Returns the value and some callbacks for interacting with the underlying state

```tsx
const [value, { push, pull toggle, contains, clear }] = useArrayState([])
```

### useBoundingClientRect

Get the size of the element with the given ref - uses a resize observer, listens to scroll events, and listens to resize events

```tsx
const contentRef = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

const [{ height, width, bottom, left, right, top, x, y }] = useBoundingClientRect(contentRef);

return <div ref={contentRef} />;
```

The second element in the return array can be used to force `useBoundingClientRect` to recalculate the `boundingClientrect`, for example if it's an element that isn't available on first render and won't trigger a resize event when it first appears, or if you need to recalculate its position when its size hasn't changed.

```tsx
const contentRef = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

const [{ height, width, bottom, left, right, top, x, y }, forceGetBoundingClientRect] = useBoundingClientRect(contentRef);

const [showThing] = React.useState(false);

React.useEffect(() => {
  if (showThing) {
    forceGetBoundingClientRect();
  }
}, [showThing]);

return showThing ? <div ref={contentRef} /> : <p>no thing</p>;
```

An unfortunate limitation of this hook is that changes to the position don't update the position returned by the hook as there's currently no way of listening to positions in Javascript without doing a gnarly polling thing, the resize observer is only triggered on size changes.

To rectify this limitation, the hook listens to resize and scroll events, and if this doesn't cover your needs you can use the `forceGetBoundingClientRect` callback if you know a position has changed... or write your own hook that uses an interval and recalculates this position every few ms.

### useDebounce

Like a state hook, but also exports a "throttled" value (set after x amount of inactivity through the setter method)

```tsx
const [actualValue, setActualValue, debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useDebounce(milliseconds, value, onValueChange);
```

### useDelayedDependentSwitch

A hook which takes a piece of boolean state and, when that is set to false, returns another piece of state which is true for a given time to act as a "closing" state

Returns an array with two booleans, the first is the given value with it being set to false delayed for a render while settingToFalse is set to true, the second is the value for isSettingFalse which, when value is set to false, is true for the given length of time

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState();

  return <InnerComponent isOpen={isOpen} />;
};

const InnerComponent = ({ isOpen }) => {
  const [delayedIsOpen, isClosing] = useDelayedDependentSwitch(isOpen, 500);

  // treat delayedIsOpen as the real isOpen, as it's still true in the render immediately when isOpen is set to false
  // see code for Modal for an example
};
```

This was a very hard thing to describe so if you think you need this and my description wasn't good enough, drop me (pat) a message

### useDebug

Fire a series of console logs alongside lifecycle events

The argument it takes will be prefixed on console logs

```tsx
useDebug('my_component');
```

### useDidMountEffect

A useEffect which will only run in the first effect

```tsx
useDidMountEffect(() => { do some stuff })
```

### useDidMountLayoutEffect

A useLayoutEffect which will only run in the first layout effect

```tsx
useDidMountLayoutEffect(() => { do some stuff })
```

### useDidUpdateEffect

A useEffect which won't run after the first render, will only run once the deps start changing

```tsx
useDidUpdateEffect(() => { do some stuff })
```

### useDidUpdateLayoutEffect

A useLayoutEffect which won't run after the first render, will only run once the deps start changing

```tsx
useDidUpdateLayoutEffect(() => { do some stuff })
```

### useDrag

Track the position of the cursor after a mouse down event, and fire a callback when the mouse is released

Can also be used for gestures as it works with touch events

```tsx
const onDragEnd = React.useCallback(
  ({ changePosition }: IDragReleaseCallbackArgs) => {
      do some stuff with the new position
  },
  []
);

const { props, changePosition, startPosition, currentPosition, isDragging } = useDrag(onDragEnd);

return <div {...props} />
```

### useElementStatus

Listen to the onLoad and onError events on an element can only be used on certain HTML tags

```tsx
const ref = React.useRef<HTMLImageElement>();

const { error, loaded, loading, props } = useElementStatus(ref);

return <img {...props} ref={ref} />;
```

The ref is used to get the initial state, as onLoad events aren't fired on `<img />` if the image is already cached

### useEventListener

Hook to add an event listener, and remove it when the component unmounts

```tsx
// the callback passed into the hook must be memoised in a useCallback
const onClick = React.useCallback(() => {}, []);

useEventListener('click', onClick, document);
```

### useGeneratedId

Generates a unique ID on first render using the current unix time and a randomly generated number up to 1000 - should be used for DOM elements when necessary for, for example, defining relationships between elements using aria

It's been used internally for hooking up aria properties like `aria-labelledby` as they mostly work based on ID

Can be overriden so that it's only used if an id isn't explicitly provided

```tsx
const MyComponent = ({ id }) => {
  const generatedId = useGeneratedId(id);

  return <div id={generatedId} />;
};
```

### useHasTimeElapsed

Returns true once a given amount of time has elapsed since the returned callback has been run

```tsx
const [hasTimeElapsed, begin, reset] = useHasTimeElapsed(time, onTimeElapse);
```

### useHasTimeElapsedSinceMount

Returns true once a given amount of time has elapsed since the component mounted

```tsx
const hasTimeElapsed = useHasTimeElapsed(time, onTimeElapse);
```

### useInfinitePaging

see useInfinitePaging storybook page

### useIntersectionObserver

Use an intersection observer to fire the passed callback - also cleans up on unmount. Can either be used by just passing in a ref, or by using the functions returned to observe and disconnect

```tsx
const ref = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement>();

useIntersectionObserver(onIntersect, intersectionObserverOptions, ref);

return <div ref={ref} />;
```

[see here for more information on the intersection observer api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)

### useInterval

Set up a interval which is cleared automatically when the component unmounts

```tsx
const onInterval = React.useCallback(() => {}, []);

const { set } = useInterval(onInterval, 100);
```

### useIsFocused

Get, in React state, whether an element is being focused.

Can be used by spreading the props returned from the second element in the returned array onto the element you want to listen to, or by passing in a ref

```tsx
const [isFocused, props] = useIsFocused();

return <div {...props} />;
```

```tsx
const ref = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement>();

const [isFocused] = useIsFocused(ref);

return <div ref={ref} />;
```

### useIsHovering

Get, in React state, whether an element is being hovered.

Can be used by spreading the props returned from the second element in the returned array onto the element you want to listen to, or by passing in a ref

```tsx
const [isHovered, props] = useIsHovered();

return <div {...props} />;
```

```tsx
const ref = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement>();

const [isHovered, props] = useIsHovered(ref);

return <div ref={ref} />;
```

### useIsInViewport

Take a ref and return a piece of React state reflecting whether the referenced element is currently in the viewport or not

```tsx
const isInViewport = useInViewport(ref, { ...intersectionObserverOptions, once: true });
```

### useMatchMedia

Returns whether the document matches the given media query string

```tsx
// will return true while the window size is less than 1600px
const isMatching = useMatchMedia('max-width: 1600px');
```

[see here for information on the match media api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)

### useMutationObserver

Use an mutation observer to fire the passed callback - also cleans up on unmount. Can either be used by just passing in a ref, or by using the functions returned to observe and disconnect

```tsx
const ref = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement>();

useIntersectionObserver(onMutation, mutationObserverOptions, ref);

return <div ref={ref} />;
```

[see here for information on the mutation observer api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Mutation_Observer_API)

### useOnScrolToEnd

Fires a given callback when an element reaches a distance from the end defined by distanceFromEdge.

Can be used by using the returned onScroll callback and adding that to the element you want to listen to.

Alternatively, there's a ScrollToEndListener component which will work more reliably as it doesn't rely on a scroll event being added to an element, and instead uses an intersection observer

```tsx
const onScrollToEnd = React.useCallback(
  () => {
      do some stuff on scroll to end
  },
  []
);

const {scrolledToEnd, onScroll} = useOnScrolToEnd(onScrollToEnd)

return (<div onScroll={onScroll} />)
```

or to put it on the document

```tsx
const { scrolledToEnd, onScroll } = useOnScrolToEnd(onScrollToEnd);

useEventListener('scroll', onScroll, document);
```

though, again, the ScrollToEndListener is more reliable as it doesn't rely on scroll listeners, so most of the time you'll want to use that

### useOverridableState

A hook wrapping up a piece of state that is optionally overriden.

Used to allow components to use some internal state that can be overriden by some props, I.E. an internal binder that can be made external

Returns either an internal useState or the given value and onChange

```tsx
const MyComponent = ({ value, onChange }) => {
  const [internaValue, setInternalValue] = useOverridableState('', value, onChange);

  // ... do some stuff with internal state
};
```

### usePerformanceObserver

Use an performance observer to fire the passed callback - also cleans up on unmount.

```tsx
usePerformanceObserver(performanceObserverCallback, performanceObserverInit);
```

[see here for information on the performance observer api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_Observer_API)

### useResizeObserver

Use an resize observer to fire the passed callback - also cleans up on unmount. Can either be used by just passing in a ref, or by using the functions returned to observe and disconnect

```tsx
const ref = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement>();

useResizeObserver(onIntersect, ResizeObserverOptions, ref);

return <div ref={ref} />;
```

[see here for more information on the resize observer api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Resize_Observer_API)

### useTemporaryState

useState but the state returns to initialValue after a given amount of time from whenever setState is called

```tsx
const [state, setState, cancel] = useTemporaryState(initialValue, time, onReset);
```

### useThrottle

Like a state hook, but also exports a "throttled" value which changes at regular intervals

```tsx
const [actualValue, setActualValue, throttleValue, setThrottledValue] = useThrottle(milliseconds, value, onValueChange);
```

### useTimeout

Set up a timeout which is cleared automatically when the component unmounts

```tsx
const { set, clear, waiting } = useTimeout(callback, time);
```

i.e.

```tsx
const { set } = useTimeout(() => console.log('DONE'), 500);

set();
```

Values can also be overriden at the function call

```tsx
const { set } = useTimeout();

set(() => console.log('DONE'), 500);
```

FYI - don't actually call set in your render method, you'll cause an infinite loop and everything will explode.

You can also use `useTimeout` like a boolean `useTemporaryState`. In this example, on the button click, hasClickedTheThing will be true for 1000ms

```tsx
const { waiting: hasClickedTheThing, set: onClickTheThing } = useTimeout(undefined, 1000);

return <Button onClick={onClickTheThing} />;
```

Finally, you can also use `set` as a promise

```tsx
const { set } = useTimeout(undefined, 1000);

const run = useCallback(async () => {
  await set();
  // 1000 ms has passed
}, [set]);
```

which can resolve to something

```tsx
const { set } = useTimeout(() => {
  return 'hello';
}, 1000);

const run = useCallback(async () => {
  const value = await set();

  console.log(value);
  // logs "hello"
}, [set]);
```

### useWillUnmountEffect

A useEffect which only runs on the cleanup of the last effect

```tsx
useWillUnmountEffect(() => { do some stuff })
```

### useWillUnmountLayoutEffect

A useLayoutEffect which only runs on the cleanup of the last layout effect

```tsx
useWillUnmountLayoutEffect(() => { do some stuff })
```

### useWindowSize

Returns the size of the window as a piece of live state, ensuring that any calculations happening during the React lifecycle that need the window size will have it up to date
and window resizes can cause rerenders

```tsx
const { innerWidth, innerHeight, outerWidth, outerHeight } = useWindowSize();
```
