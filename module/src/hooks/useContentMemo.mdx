### useContentMemo

Returns a reference to the passed in item which only updates when the _content_ of the item updates rather than just the pointer reference

**WARNING:** This hook was designed for config/state objects and assumes that array/object items are serializable

```tsx
const valueContent = useContentMemo(props.myArray);

React.useEffect(() => {
  // trigger something based on the fact that the content of the array has changed, not just the reference
}, [valueContent]);
```
