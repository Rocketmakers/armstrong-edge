## SCSS for Armstrong developers

### SCSS concatenation implementation

SCSS files can be used anywhere inside src/ and will be automatically concatenated during build based on a naming convention: `inputName.outputName.scss`

For example, `textInput.basic.scss` and `selectInput.basic.scss` will be automatically found from anywhere in the project and concatenated into `basic.scss` at the root of `dist/`

This allows us to write multiple custom themes, or groups of styles, that can be imported from one place. If we ever wanted to add a `funky` theme, we would just need to add `textInput.funky.scss` everywhere.

This will also work to copy over files like `src/theme/animations.scss` into `dist/animations.scss`
