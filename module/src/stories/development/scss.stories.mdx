# SCSS for Armstrong developers

### Some quick rules

- Keep your SCSS as flat as possible to make sure it's easily overridable
- Add important layout styles to `*.basic.scss` files that are necessary for the functionaing of the component, and add anything extra to make it look good to `*.prototyping.scss` files
- Document any variables and mixins you add in Storybook
- Don't do any SCSS functions (like darken or whatever) on SCSS variables - we want these to be able to work if overriden as CSS variables whose values aren't available to SCSS at build time

### SCSS concatenation implementation

SCSS files can be used anywhere inside src/ and will be automatically concatenated during build based on a naming convention: `inputName.outputName.scss`

For example, `textInput.basic.scss` and `selectInput.basic.scss` will be automatically found from anywhere in the project and concatenated into `basic.scss` at the root of `dist/`

This allows us to write multiple custom themes, or groups of styles, that can be imported from one place. If we ever wanted to add a `funky` theme, we would just need to add `textInput.funky.scss` everywhere.

This will also work to copy over files like `src/theme/animations.scss` into `dist/animations.scss`
