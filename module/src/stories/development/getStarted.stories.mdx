<Meta title="Armstrong Development/Get Started" />

## Get Started

First clone the repo from TODO

Then, cd into the root of the repo and run

```sh
npm install
```

There are two options for working on Armstrong.

- We have a playground, which is just a really simple react app with no linting, which has the Armstrong module linked in using `npm link`
- We have a Storybook implementation which will pick up any files with the pattern `*.stories.tsx`

_For the playground_, run

```sh
npm start

# then in separate window from /module run
npm run start-sass
```

then go to `localhost:3001`

_For Storybook_, run

```sh
npm run storybook

# then in separate window from /module run
npm run start-sass
```

then go to `localhost:6006`

`npm run start-sass` will spin up a watcher which will watch all SASS files and rebuild them

For more information on using SASS, see SASS Concatenation in [SCSS](STORYBOOK LINK TODO)

### Process

Please work in feature branches named `feature/*` or if your branch is on a single ticket `feature/ARM-000/*`

When your work is ready, submit a merge request and (if you're internal) post a link to your merge request in the `#armstrong` slack channel for someone to review.

There will be a CI which will run to check if your work passes linting and if Storybook can still build.

One day we will talk about testing....
