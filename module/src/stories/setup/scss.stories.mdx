# SCSS Setup

### Packages

Armstrong is written to be used with [dart-sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass), which (as it's the primary version of sass currently) is installed using the [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) package on npm

If used with [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass), which is deprecated and lacks some newer sass features, there is a decent chance some stuff won't build as it's not fully tested

If you're on a project that uses Webpack with sass-loader (which includes many tools like Gatsby under the hood) ensure that the node-sass package is uninstalled, and the sass package is installed, as sass-loader uses whichever is available

### Imports

Armstrong uses SCSS which isn't compiled down before build, allowing the consuming app to handle compiling and use our exported variables and mixins.

To use SCSS from Armstrong, it must be imported into your app's SCSS:

```css
// variables and mixins - required for the rest of armstrong to work
@import '~@rocketmakers/armstrong/dist/imports.scss';

// includes a tonne of useful animations (required for use in the animated.scss theme)
@import '~@rocketmakers/armstrong/dist/animations.scss';

// basic theme - includes only functional and layout styling
@import '~@rocketmakers/armstrong/dist/basic.scss';

// OPTIONAL prototyping theme - includes more production-ready styling, like drop shadows and colours
// must be imported on top of basic theme
@import '~@rocketmakers/armstrong/dist/prototyping.scss';
```

### Themes

Armstrong supports various degrees of styling to ensure that, depending on the kind of project you're working on, you can either get off the ground quickly with components that already look good, or can have complete control of your own styling beyond the bare minimum of functional styling.

- **basic.scss** — the bare minimum functional SCSS to override some default browser styling and to lay out components - should be imported before other themes
- **prototyping.scss** — a more advanced stylesheet with decent looking styling, allowing a project to get off the ground a lot more quickly, used in Storybook. This theme is designed to be used on top of `basic.scss`
- **animated.scss** — adds animations across many components, must be used alongside an import of `animations.scss`. This theme is designed to be used on top of any other theme.
