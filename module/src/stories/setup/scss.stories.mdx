# SCSS Setup

Armstrong uses SCSS which isn't compiled down before build, allowing the consuming app to handle compiling and use our exported variables and mixins.

To use SCSS from Armstrong, it must be imported into your app's SCSS:

```css
// variables and mixins - required for the rest of armstrong to work
@import '~@rocketmakers/armstrong-edge/dist/imports.scss';

// includes a tonne of useful animations (required for use in the animated.scss theme)
@import '~@rocketmakers/armstrong-edge/dist/animations.scss';

// basic theme - includes only functional and layout styling
@import '~@rocketmakers/armstrong-edge/dist/basic.scss';

// prototyping theme - includes more production-ready styling, like drop shadows and colours
// must be imported on top of basic theme
@import '~@rocketmakers/armstrong-edge/dist/prototyping.scss';
```

### Existing themes

- **basic.scss** — the bare minimum functional SCSS to override some default browser styling and to lay out components - should be imported before other themes
- **prototyping.scss** — a more advanced stylesheet with decent looking styling, allowing a project to get off the ground a lot more quickly, used in Storybook. This theme is designed to be used on top of `basic.scss`
- **animated.scss** — adds animations across many components, must be used alongside an import of `animations.scss`. This theme is designed to be used on top of any other theme.
