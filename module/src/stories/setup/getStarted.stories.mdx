# Get Started

Armstrong is installed using `npm`.

```bash
npm install @rocketmakers/armstrong
# or
yarn add @rocketmakers/armstrong
```

Then to use a component in your project

```tsx
import { Button } from "@rocketmakers/armstrong";

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>I'm a button</Button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

You will also need to import some styling to get started (or, if you're feeling adventurous, you can start from scratch and write your own) see Setup/SCSS for more details.
