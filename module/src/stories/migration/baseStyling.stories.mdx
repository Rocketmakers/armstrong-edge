### Setup

The setup process for styling has slightly changed, please see the setup/SCSS page in storybook.

Crucially, we've split out the styling into two distinct themes, where one is simpler and much easier to override, and the other is way easier to get up and running with.

### New classNames

All classNames have been changed in Newstrong.

Where previously there was risk of them conflicting with your own classNames, or those from other libraries, they have now all been prepended with `.arm-*` for easier styling.

### New variables

The list of variables has been altered slightly, checked the page in Storybook on SCSS variables.

You can now override variables that are defined in individual components to override certain pieces of styling more easily - details are given in the Strorybook page on SCSS variables

### Normalise is removed

Armstrong no longer uses `normalise` to remove native styling outside of Armstrong, you're going to add it yourself. (It'll be in all the Rocketmakers boilerplates)

Instead, the basic theme adds a few overrides scoped to all armstrong (`-arm`) classNames.
