## Form Components

This guide includes migration guides for form elements that have significantly changed, or where those changes aren't clear from the types.

### TextInput and TextAreaInput

The TextInput's `multiLine` prop previously made the TextInput render a textarea instead of an input. This prop has been removed in favour of a new TextAreaInput component.

```tsx
// old
<TextInput multiLine />

// new
<TextAreaInput />
```

Additionally, TextInput has been split into a number of different components most of which just add `type=X` but NumberInput uses a numeric bind prop.

### SelectInput

There is now a DOM based select alternative called ListBox (it's a silly name but w3c recommend it in their aria docs so...) which can be optionally used in substitute.

The native SelectInput has been renamed Select.
