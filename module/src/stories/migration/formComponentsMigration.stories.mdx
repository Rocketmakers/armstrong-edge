## Form Components

This guide includes migration guides for form elements that have significantly changed, or been split up, or where those changes aren't clear from the types.

### TextInput and TextArea

The TextInput's `multiLine` prop previously made the TextInput render a textarea instead of an input. This prop has been removed in favour of a new TextAreaInput component.

```tsx
// old
<TextInput multiLine />

// new
<TextArea />
```

Additionally, TextInput has been split into a number of different components most of which just add `type=X`.

I.E. `NumberInput`, `NativeDateInput`, `PasswordInput`

### SelectInput

There is now a DOM based select alternative called `ListBox` (it's a silly name but w3c recommend it in their aria docs so...) and `ListBoxMulti` which can be optionally used in substitute.

The native SelectInput has been renamed Select.

### AutoCompleteInput

The AutoCompleteInput has had something of a rewrite - a few properties have changed, and the useOptions hooks have been removed, preferring instead to take a memoised list of options, letting you handle the filtering yourself,

By default, it will handle filtering of the given options internally.

```tsx
// old
const { DataForm, bind } = useForm(initialData);

const { filter, options, setFilter } = useOptions([
  { id: 'a', name: 'thing' },
  { id: 'b', name: 'other thing' },
]);

return (
  <DataForm>
    <AutoCompleteInput {...bind.autoCompleteInput('thing')} options={options} filter={filter} onFilterChange={setFilter} />
  </DataForm>
);
```

```tsx
// new
const { formProp } = Form.use({ thing: '' });

return (
  <AutoCompleteInput
    bind={formProp.bind('thing')}
    options={[
      { id: 'a', name: 'thing' },
      { id: 'b', name: 'other thing' },
    ]}
  />
);
```

The above example will filter options based on whether they start with the value in the input
