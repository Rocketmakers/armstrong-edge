## Dialogs

There is now a core modal component which is a stripped back version of the old Dialog component - it just renders a div that portals somewhere.

Modal portals can be configured to portal into a few different options of root element:

1. the body by default
2. an `.arm-modal-layer` element rendered by the `ModalProvider` if it's present, which works by passing a ref into context which is consumed by the `Modal`
3. an element that is passed by `portalInto` prop into the `Modal`
4. an element selected by document.QuerySelector from the `portalIntoSelector` prop

Using the `ModalProvider` is the recommended method, as it maintains control of where your modals end up while still using more Reacty best practicesy patterns.

The new Dialog `component` uses the `Modal` under the hood, and works the same way as the oldstrong `Dialog`, other than the new portal behaviour specified above.

Another feature of the `ModalProvider` is that it provides the context used for `useModal` and `useDialog` which are hooks designed to work the same way as the old `useDialogProvider` hook - when the callback they return is run, it opens a Modal and returns a promise that is resolved when the user performs a defined action inside that Modal.

For detailed information on using that hook, see `useModal and useDialog` in Storybook

The only breaking change when switching from `useDialogProvider` to `useDialog` is that it now returns an array where the second element in that array has an object with some state on it (currently only used for isOpen)

```tsx
// old
const open = useDialogProvider(() => <p>HIYA</p>);

// new
const [open, { isOpen }] = useDialogProvider(() => <p>HIYA</p>);
```
