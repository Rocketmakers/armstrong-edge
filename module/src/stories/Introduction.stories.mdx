# Welcome to the Armstrong Storybook

Armstrong is a React component library made by [Rocketmakers](rocketmakers.com/) written in Typescript and SCSS.

### How to use these docs

We use Storybook to generate documentation.

The sidebar contains a list of articles and demonstrations of different components.

Each component page has two tabs:

- Canvas is a demonstration of the component in an example state, many of these are set up with controls to allow you to experiment with different props in place
- Docs allows you to look at the code for each of these demonstrations
