# CSS Animations

Animations for CSS.

Most animations have variants based on the size and direction which use variables that can be overriden (see `SCSS/variables`)

## Use

These are used as any other CSS animations:

```CSS
animation: slide-in-up-large $transition-quick;
```

The full list of animations is given below.

## Slide

slide-in-up-medium
slide-in-up-small

slide-in-down-large
slide-in-down-medium

</Canvas>
