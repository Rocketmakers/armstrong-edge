### Toast Notifications

Toast notifications are short term popups that appear for a few seconds to alert users to activity.

Armstrong exports a bunch of components that can be used in conjunction to render toast notifications, and a series of hooks that can be used to dispatch and render them.

The most common way you are most likely to interact with Armstrong toasts is using the `useToastDispatch` hook with the `ToastProvider` component.

### The ToastProvider

The `ToastProvider` provides the toast context that's used by that hook, and it also renders the toasts into a `ToastContainer` element.

```tsx
const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <ToastProvider>
      <MyView />
    </ToastProvider>
  );
};

const MyView = () => {
  const dispatchToast = useToastDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={() => dispatchToast("I'm a toast")}>Dispatch</Button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

When that button is clicked, a toast notification will be dispatched over the top of the screen.

There are a number of options available in the ToastProvider for customising how toasts work:

These are applied as props on the provider.

```tsx
const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <ToastProvider location="bottom-right" autoDismissTime={1000}>
      <MyView />
    </ToastProvider>
  );
};
```

<ArgsTable of={ToastProvider} />

There are also a number of customisations that can be used when running `useToastDispatch` which are passed in as an `IToastNotification` object when running the callback it returns.

```tsx
const dispatchToast = useToastDispatch();

const submit = React.useCallback(() => {
  dispatchToast({
    title: "It's toast o'clock",
    htmlProps: { className: "my-cool-toast" },
    location: "top-right",
    type: "error",
  });
}, []);
```

<ArgsTable of={ToastNotification} />

The callback returned from `useToastDispatch` can also take an args array or strings or `IToastNotification`s

```tsx
const dispatchToast = useToastDispatch();

const submit = React.useCallback(() => {
  dispatchToast(
    { title: "It's toast o'clock" },
    { title: "I'm another toast" },
    "hey hey hey"
  );
}, []);
```

### Using Toasts without the Toast context

If you don't want to use the toast context, but still want to use the Armstrong toast components, those components are exported as well.

`ToastNotification` will render a single toast notification in place.

```tsx
<ToastNotification title="I'm a toast" onDismiss={() => { some stuff }} />
```

`ToastNotificationContainer` will render an array of toast notifications, overlaid on top of the whole UI with `position: fixed`.

```tsx
<ToastNotificationContainer toasts={[{ title: "I'm a toast" }]} />
```

### Using the Toast context without the Armstrong components

The Toast context can also optionally disable rendering any toasts, if you want to handle them completely on your own.

The hook `useToasts` will return an array of dispatched toast notifications. You will need to reimplement a fair few things yourself to replicate all the functionality of useToasts, like `position` and `autoDismissTime`. It also returns callbacks to dismiss the toasts, and the toast config given to the provider

Below is an example reimplementation of toast notifications.

```tsx
const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <ToastProvider renderToastContainer={false}>
      <MyView />
      <MyToasts />
    </ToastProvider>
  );
};

const MyView = () => {
  const dispatchToast = useToastDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={() => dispatchToast("I'm a toast")}>Dispatch</Button>
    </div>
  );
};

const MyToasts = () => {
  const {
    toasts,
    dismiss,
    config: { position },
  } = useToasts();

  return (
    <div className="toasts">
      {toasts.map((toast) => (
        <p data-position={position} onClick={() => dismiss(toast)}>
          {toast.title}
        </p>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

`renderToastContainer={false}` is the key part for disabling the default Armstrong toast display
