# Toast

Toasts are small message modals that can be dispatched globally

## How to use global toast in your app

### Step 1 - Wrap your app in the provider

In order for global toast to work, you must first wrap your app in the unified armstrong provider, like so:

```tsx
import { ArmstrongProvider } from '@rocketmakers/armstrong-edge';

export const MyApp: React.FC<React.PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
  return <ArmstrongProvider>{children}</ArmstrongProvider>;
};
```

NOTE: The unified provider allows you to pass global Armstrong config as well as supports toast messages. If you specifically only want the toast messages, you can use `<ToastProvider>` instead but this is not recommended.

### Step 2 - Use the toast hook to dispatch a toast message

Toast messages can be dispatched from any component within the provider using the toast hook, like so:

```tsx
import { useToast, IToast } from '@rocketmakers/armstrong-edge';

export const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const dispatchToast = useToast();

  const toastMessage: IToast = {
    title: 'Here is a toast!',
    description: 'Here is the description for my toast',
  };

  return <button onClick={() => dispatchToast(toastMessage)}>Send a toast</button>;
};
```

See it in action here:

<Canvas withSource="closed">
  <Story id="modals-toast--default" />
</Canvas>

### Step 3 (optional) - Configure your toast using Armstrong global config

Toast messages come out of the box with a sensible set of default properties, but if you need to change the way toast behaves, you can pass config into the unified Armstrong provider like so:

```tsx
import { ArmstrongProvider } from '@rocketmakers/armstrong-edge';

export const MyApp: React.FC<React.PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <ArmstrongProvider config={{ toastDuration: 10000, toastPosition: 'top-right' }}>{children}</ArmstrongProvider>
  );
};
```

NOTE: These settings can also be passed in as props to the `<ToastProvider>` if you're using that, and `duration` can also be set on a per-toast basis
