# Welcome to the Armstrong Storybook

Armstrong is a React component library made by [Rocketmakers](rocketmakers.com/) written in Typescript and SCSS.

The core of Armstrong is its form logic, built with Typescript as a first class citizen, and the many customiseable inputs built to work with it. Armstrong's forms are easily extensible to allow you to extend it with your own input components easily.

Alongside this is a collection of other useful components designed to make building React UIs much faster and much easier without compromising on personalisation.

### How to use these docs

We use Storybook to generate documentation.

The sidebar contains a list of articles and demonstrations of different components.

Each component page has two tabs:

- Canvas is a demonstration of the component in an example state, many of these are set up with controls to allow you to experiment with different props in place
- Docs allows you to look at the code for each of these demonstrations
